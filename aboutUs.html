        <div class="content"><h5>SINCERITY, KNOWLEDGE AND COMMITMENT--- With this mission, "NISHANT TANWAR CLASSES (NTC)" was established in the year 2014 to provide quality coaching in physics to
            the students at academic and professional level. </h5> <h5>Though, Nishant Tanwar Classes was established in the year 2014, the name Nishant Tanwar (Founder of the NTC Institute) is a well known name since 2009, as a reputed teacher, in the science student's fraternity. Nishant Tanwar is a Fellow Member of content team (subject matter expert) in various reputed E-learning companies. He has a teaching and industry experience of more than 14 years. <br></h5><h5>
            In the past, students of Science stream were facing certain problems such as lack of specialized coaching, guidance, first hand treatment, etc. Analyzing and in order to solve
            these problems, NTC was established to provide specialized coaching, excellent infrastructure, proper guidance, first hand treatment, etc. to the students. We, at NTC, believe that every Science stream student needs different nurturing and specialized coaching according to the requirements. Further, a person belonging to a particular profession can only mentor and groom the students of that stream. To reinforce this belief, we started NTC. <br> </h5> <h5> Potential you have it; we know it............let us prove it!! This is what we here believe in. Just imparting of information is not enough, success of the students starts with the teacher's confidence in students. <br> </h5>
            <h5> The "Guru-Shishya Parampara", old fashioned though it may sound, signifies the unique bond that a student enjoys with his teacher, ensures that faculty goes that extra mile to deliver to the students, without keeping anything in reserve.</h5></div>
